"""Mirror Bifrost's providers into ``llm_provider_configs``.

Bifrost's config store holds the credentials and does the routing, but the rest
of Vigil indexes providers by ``llm_provider_configs`` row: the model picker
aggregates over those rows (``ModelRegistry.list_available_models``),
``ai_model_configs.provider_id`` FKs to one, and ``get_provider_spec`` resolves
dispatch through one. Two-store readiness (#761) taught the setup gate to read
Bifrost directly, but only the gate — so a key added in Bifrost alone put a
checkmark on the first setup step and left every surface past it reading a
table nothing had written: an empty picker, no assignment savable, no spec to
dispatch through.

A mirror row closes that. It is an index entry, not a second config: no
``api_key_ref`` (Bifrost holds the secret) and no ``base_url`` (the gateway
owns routing). One row per provider *type*, which is all the dispatch path
reads off it — Bifrost load-balances the keys within a provider itself.

Rows are written from two places, both of which converge on the same state:
the config proxy on an accepted key write (``services/api/routers/bifrost_config``),
and ``reconcile_all`` on every catalogue sync, which backfills providers that
were configured before this existed.

# Vertex cannot be list-verified under any auth Vigil offers: under an API key
# Bifrost refuses before trying, and under a service account or ADC the listing
